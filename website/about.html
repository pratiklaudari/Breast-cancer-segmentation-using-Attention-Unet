            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our college project website, where innovation meets healthcare in the fight against cancer. We are a dedicated team of three students from Advanced College of engineering , committed to leveraging ultrasound technology for breast cancer segmentation. Our project aims to contribute to the field of medical imaging by developing solutions that assist medical professionals in accurately identifying and delineating cancerous regions within ultrasound scans. With a shared passion for both technology and healthcare, we are excited to showcase the potential of AI-driven solutions in enhancing early-stage detection and more effective treatment strategies. As students driven by curiosity and the desire to make a positive impact, we invite you to explore our journey and discoveries as we strive to learn, grow, and contribute to the advancement of cancer diagnosis.</p>
